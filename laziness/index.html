    <p> Laziness just happens. One minute, you're being productive doing something for school or work and the next you catch yourself laying around with no motivation at all. It's natural. We all want a break from working hard. It's okay to be lazy sometimes! And if you've made it this far through this paragraph, congratulations! The laziness spell hasn't kicked in yet. But most of you reading this will probably be too lazy to read all this information. I'll keep going anyways...</p>
    <p> Some people associate being lazy with being a couch potato and the word "lazy" often as a negative connotation. However, being lazy can also make one smarter and more innovative with the creation of ideas that make an activity more convenient. Being lazy could mean not wanting to make multiple trips from the garage to the kitchen to bring in groceries in which case, you would probably try to carry all of the bags groceries in at once. </p>
    <h2>Definition of Laziness</h2>
